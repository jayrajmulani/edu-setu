## About

"Setu" literally translates to "Bridge" in Hindi.

Our project, Edu-Setu, as the name suggests, is a portal that bridges opportunities and can be immensely helpful in the education domain. We all know how cumbersome it can be to manage emails, segregate the important ones and keeping track of the _Loooooooonnngggggg_ mail chains. Opportunities get buried under these tons and tons of emails.

You might be wondering "what" opportunities exactly? Well, the one that every studnet desires to have and every professor usually need to offer! Yes, Edu-Setu facilitates professors to post opportunities for students which may include, but not liimited to:

- Research Opportunities
- Part time roles (On Campus)
- Project Opportunities
- Volunteering Opportunities

And, as you might have guessed, students can come in to apply and connect with the professors via this portal. Edu-Setu keeps the track of all the postings and applications, removing the hassle of "emailing" the professor and waiting for the opportunities to get buried.
